<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span lang=EN-US>TWENTY-FOURTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME
(11<sup>th</sup>/12<sup>th</sup>  September 2021)</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>~ Fr Frank writes:  </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>It is a great privilege to have been asked to care for the Parish of
St Francis in addition to Blessed Robert Grissold church in Balsall Common.  It
is because I have two Masses on a Sunday that I have had to change the time of
the Sunday Mass at Baddesley Clinton to 1100.  I regret any inconvenience this
has caused but, as I am sure you are aware, there is a shortage of priests and 
many of us have to double up on our workload.  You have my assurance that I
will do my best to serve both parishes fairly and to the best of my ability
but, with the added workload, I am hoping for your practical support.  Please
keep me in your prayers as you are in mine.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>~ Weekday Masses  </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>There will be a Mass at 9.00am on Thursdays at St Francis, Baddesley
Clinton.  There will also be a Mass at BRG, Balsall Common at 10.00am on
Tuesdays.  This arrangement assumes that the usual precautions and cleaning
regime can be put in place.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>~ A Summary of the Guidance from the
Bishop</span>’</b><b><span lang=EN-US>s Conference concerning Step 4 of the
Government</span>’</b><b><span lang=EN-US>s Covid-19 roadmap which comes into
effect on Monday 19<sup>th</sup> July 2021.</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>At this stage it is important for us all to
remember that although legislation has been relaxed, the pandemic is not yet
over and there continues to be a duty of care for all who use our churches. 
The guidance seeks to ensure there remains a cautious  approach that encourages
the continuation of social distancing, mask wearing and cleaning regimes in
order to help to minimise risk and provide comfort and confidence to our
people.  Churches should continue to provide hand sanitiser at entrances and
exits and face coverings are strongly recommended to be worn by those in
church. General cleaning should be to a high standard with special attention to
frequent touch points.  Buildings should be well ventilated and as long as the
NHS Test, Track and Trace system is in operation, churches should continue to
make available the means for people to sign in for acts of worship using the
NHS app and the associated QR codes or by other  means of attendee identification. 
In the light of the Bishop</span>’<span lang=EN-US>s Guidance and the
Government</span>’<span lang=EN-US>s call for caution and with a care for the
most vulnerable among us, I propose that we should continue in much the same
way as we have been until the advice from the Archdiocese changes.  This will
help to protect the vulnerable among us and it will also give confidence to
people who are  hesitant about attending Mass. Please see below the
restrictions which remain in place for the time being.  Thanks to all the
volunteers who are making Mass possible.  </span></p>
