<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span lang=EN-US>FIFTH SUNDAY IN ORDINARY TIME</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i><span lang=EN-US>After the miraculous catch of fish,
which we hear about in the Gospel today, Peter realised, as never before, his
own sinfulness and the holiness of Jesus.  He asked Jesus to depart from him
but Christ showed him that his sins and weaknesses would not prevent him from
sharing in his work.  While our sinfulness humbles us we should not let it get
us down or make us feel that we do not belong to the company of Christ.  Christ
came to </span>“</i><i><span lang=EN-US>call sinners.</span>”</i><i><span
lang=EN-US>  He is known as the </span>“</i><i><span lang=EN-US>friend of
sinners</span>”</i><i><span lang=EN-US> - he comes to help us to overcome our
sins.  That is why, with confidence, we have recourse to the Sacrament of
Reconciliation and come before him in the Mass to confess our sins.</span></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Second Collection for LIFE today</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Prayer for Religious  </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>During the month of February Pope Francis encourages us to pray for
Religious and consecrated women.  Please pray for Sr Felicity and all Religious
and consecrated women in the Archdiocese, asking God to continue to guard,
guide and bless them.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Prayer for the Ukraine  </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>At this dangerous moment on the Ukraine/Russia border please pray
for the Ukrainian Eparchy, for Bishop Kenneth Nowakowski and for his clergy and
people - remembering also the Ukrainian parishes in our own Archdiocese -
praying for a lasting peace.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Confirmation </span></b><span
lang=EN-US> Please submit names to Fr Frank of those wishing to prepare for
Confirmation this year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Lifting of Restrictions  </span></b><span
lang=EN-US>Following the Church</span>’<span lang=EN-US>s guidance for safe
uses of places of worship we will continue to gradually lift restrictions over
the next few weeks. This guidance states that </span>‘<span lang=EN-US>there is
still a risk associated with gathering for sustained periods in enclosed spaces
and therefore there needs to be continued caution by all against infection</span>’<span
lang=EN-US> and those </span>‘<span lang=EN-US>displaying symptoms of Covid-19
should stay at home and not participate in acts of worship in church.</span>’<span
lang=EN-US>  Also, </span>‘<span lang=EN-US>those attending an act of worship
may continue to wear a face covering.</span>’<span lang=EN-US>  It is advised
that churches should </span>‘<span lang=EN-US>continue to ensure good
ventilation</span>’<span lang=EN-US> - so continue to wrap up warm.  We look
forward to the return of congregational singing, though there is a general
encouragement </span>‘<span lang=EN-US>to wear face coverings while singing.</span>’<span
lang=EN-US>  In conclusion, the church</span>’<span lang=EN-US>s guidance
reminds us that </span>‘<span lang=EN-US>whilst this reduction of restrictions
brings about a more normal way of living, the Covid-19 virus is still in circulation,
and this should be in the mind of those participating in the life of the Church
as time goes forward holding in balance the need for personal safety and taking
responsibility for that safety.</span>’</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><i><span lang=EN-US>Please <u>DO NOT</u> attend church if
you, or someone in your household, has:  a high temperature or new, continuous
cough or loss, or change, to your sense of taste or smell.  You must stay at
home.  </span></i></b><span lang=EN-US>(Guidance from the Bishop</span>’<span

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>Meeting regarding Pope Francis</span>’</b><b><span
lang=EN-US> Synodal Process<i>  </i></span></b><span lang=EN-US>In preparation
for our participation in the Synodal Process I have devised a questionnaire to
help us reflect, individually and in small groups, through prayerful
reflection, discussion and listening, how we can respond to what the Holy
Spirit is saying to us today.  I would be pleased to receive written responses
to those questions which most interest you and I will use your written
responses in formulating a response to the Archdiocese who will forward a
summary of the feedback from parishes to the Synod on Synodality in Rome in
2023.  To this end there is a meeting planned for <b>Wednesday 10<sup>th</sup>
February at 7.30pm at the Old School House - All welcome.</b></span></p>
