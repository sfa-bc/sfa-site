                    <h2>St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Church</h2>
                    <p>
                        Prior to the Reformation the Catholics of Baddesley Clinton worshipped in the medieval parish
                        church of St Michael, close
                        to Baddesley Clinton House, which had been owned since 1517 by the Ferrers Family. The Ferrers
                        remained
                        loyal to the Catholic Faith and Mass was offered in their domestic chapel. The quiet but dogged
                        resistance
                        of the Ferrers and other local magnates helps to explain the survival of Catholicism in this
                        part
                        of the Forest of Arden. Henry Ferrers (1549-1633) was imprisoned, probably by force of fines
                        under
                        the recusancy laws, in 1599, and it is known that for a time ‘Sir William, the priest at
                        Badsley’
                        was resident in the house.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <div class="span10">
                            <img class="center-block" src="images/baddesley-clinton-hall.jpg" />
                        </div>
                        <br /> During the late 1580s and early 1590s Henry leased the house to two daughters of Lord
                        Vaux who were
                        devout Catholics. During their time the house became a secret meeting place for Jesuit priests
                        and
                        hiding holes were constructed, probably by St Nicholas Owen, to conceal them from discovery. On
                        19th
                        October 1591, at the end of a conference of Jesuits from all parts of England, the house was
                        raided
                        by pursuivants. Five Jesuit priests and two secular priests (four other Jesuits having left the
                        night
                        before) were hidden for four hours ankle-deep in water in a hide that was a converted sewer. In
                        1603
                        the itinerant priest John Sugar was captured nearby, together with Robert Grissold, possibly
                        after
                        having celebrated Mass in the house, and in October 1611 it was related that ‘in Warwickshire
                        and
                        in the parts adjoining the pursuivants this last summer by searching have much troubled the
                        Catholics.’
                        Despite all this, Catholicism continued to survive in Baddesley Clinton and the surrounding
                        area,
                        although the secret nature of the mission of the priests who, under assumed names and in
                        disguise,
                        ministered to the faithful at the risk of their lives means that few details have come down to
                        us.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the middle of the seventeenth century Baddesley Clinton House became the headquarters of the
                        Franciscan Fathers of the
                        Second English Province. Fr Leo Randolph, a kinsman of the Ferrers, used the house as a base for
                        his ministry throughout Warwickshire and Staffordshire. For a time Fr William Levison also lived
                        there; he was able to minister to the needs of St John Wall under sentence of death in Worcester
                        Gaol at the time of the bogus Titus Oates Plat (1679-80). St John Wall had himself ministered in
                        Warwickshire in the late 1650s and must have visited Baddesley.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the accession of the Catholic James II, hopes were raised of some relief for his Catholic
                        subjects. Fr Leo established
                        a mission in Rowington, two miles from Baddesley, in 1686, and in the same year built a chapel
                        in
                        Warwick. A year later he built another chapel and friary in Birmingham for which George Ferrers
                        provided
                        timber from the Baddesley estate. Both chapels were destroyed by the mob in 1688 when James was
                        deposed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Franciscans, however, continued to minister to the district around Baddesley, and in 1756
                        Father George Bishop, O.S.F.,
                        took up residence in the house. After a disagreement with Thomas Ferrers he moved out of the
                        house
                        to Baddesley Green. This was a providential move since after the death of Thomas Ferrers in 1760
                        the house remained unoccupied for fifty years. Fr Bishop built a small chapel and established
                        what
                        can be described as the first permanent mission in Baddesley Clinton that was independent of the
                        Ferrers family. In 1785 a Franciscan school or academy moved to Baddesley Green from Edgbaston
                        on
                        the outskirts of Birmingham and new buildings were erected for it in 1793 on the present site.
                        Adjoining
                        the academy a small chapel was built and registered for Divine Service in 1800; a cemetery was
                        added
                        in 1845. Fr Bishop had retired in 1790, often returning to Baddesley before his death in 1811.
                        He
                        was regarded as the founder, not only of the mission, but also of the church, and he was buried
                        beneath
                        the sanctuary of the chapel. A plaque on the wall of what is now the altar servers’ sacristy
                        records
                        the spot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Franciscans had to close their academy in 1829 and the Mission was taken over by the Vicar
                        Apostolic of the Midland District,
                        who appointed William Benson as Missioner. Secular priests have served the Mission (later
                        Parish)
                        from that date until the present day. In 1850 the Poor Clares arrived from Bruges in Belgium to
                        establish
                        the first Convent of Poor Clares of the Colettine Reform in England since the Reformation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 1860s found the small chapel falling into decay. The few parishioners were so poor that
                        little could be done. However,
                        in 1857 Agnes Mary Clifford, daughter of the Hon. Charles Clifford (brother of Hugh Charles, 7th
                        baron Clifford of Chudleigh, co. Devon), had been professed in the Poor Clare Community and
                        brought
                        a considerable dowry. Thanks to this, and the generosity of her parents (who are buried before
                        the
                        sanctuary of the present church), and also the large dowry of Sr Mary Clare Dymock, new
                        conventual
                        buildings were erected, together with a new church, presbytery (1882) and school (closed in 1990
                        and converted to domestic use in 2015). The old chapel, standing on the site of the present
                        Sisters’
                        choir, was demolished, and a church, designed by Benjamin Bucknall of Swansea, was built by J.
                        Hall
                        of Warwick. It was dedicated to St Francis of Assisi and opened on his feast day, 4th October,
                        1870.
                        It was consecrated on 5th September 1894. The connection with the Ferrers family remained strong
                        throughout these years. Marmion Edward Ferrers (1813-1884) gave or leased the land on which the
                        convent
                        was built, and his wife, Rebecca Dulcibella Orpen, adorned the sanctuary with paintings and
                        executed
                        the Stations of the Cross in the body of the church. Members of the family were buried by the
                        side
                        of the church.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 1963 a side-chapel was added to enable the Sisters to see Mass being celebrated (hitherto
                        they had attended in their choir
                        and only heard Mass being offered) and the sanctuary was altered in 1970. The cemetery is still
                        in
                        use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In January 2011, because of a decline in the number of professed Sisters, the Poor Clares made
                        the decision to leave Baddesley
                        Clinton. The four remaining Sisters transferred their allegiance to the Poor Clares Community of
                        Much Birch, Hereford. The Mass chapel was demolished and the church returned to its pre-1963
                        state.
                        The former Sisters’ Choir was given to the parish for its use, while the conventual buildings
                        were
                        sold and converted into a series of domestic dwellings.
