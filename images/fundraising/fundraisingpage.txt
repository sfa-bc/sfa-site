St. Francis of Assisi, Baddesley Clinton, Restoration Project
Renovating the church
we are celebrating the 150th anniversary

Next year (2020), we shall be celebrating the 150th anniversary of the opening of the present church of St Francis of Assisi, Baddesley Clinton, on 4th October 1870.

In time for the anniversary, we are hoping to restore the organ and to undertake a major scheme of redecoration. Please go to our website, www.sfachurch.org.uk for more details.

The cost of the project will be about £120,000, and we have already raised £15,000.  We will continue to fund-raise but would be grateful for any contributions we receive to help us reach our target.

Mass is offered every month for donors and benefactors.  The names of donors will be recorded in a special commemorative book, together with their intentions.
